# Price_checker

This code will track the bunnings website and take record of certain producut's price, displayname, fineline and other properties and write them in to a data base. 

I'm planning to make this code automatic running and keep recording the daily price of each product. after peroid of time, you can build a price history.

more features to develop:

  + tracking SCA / COSTCO / COLES / WOOLWORTH / CARSALES / Realestate / STOCK.
  + making Database viewr for looking each product and price history, product pictures.
  + send reminder when something is lower than it's hostorical price.
